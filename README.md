# CPLD-Digital-Signage-
A complete digital signage project implemented on the LP-2900 CPLD development board using Verilog HDL. It drives an 8×8 LED dot matrix display to show messages. The system uses clock division, multiplexing, memory-mapped patterns, and mode selection through physical switches, achieving smooth, flicker-free scrolling and animation.
